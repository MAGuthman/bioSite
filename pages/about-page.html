                    <h2>Mother. Student. Editor.</h2>
                    <p>Sara Guthman takes on many hats and at just twenty-seven years old, has accomplished much in her
                        life. From becoming a mother at age twenty-four, to starting her own business at twenty-six,
                        Sara is
                        on the go, always working towards the next goal. She is a true inspiration for her friends and
                        family.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Early Years</h3>
                    <p>Sara grew up in an average household with her two parents, one older sister and one younger
                        sister.
                        As a child, Sara was a shy individual with a creative spirit and a love for reading. Her parents
                        often joke that most nights in the crib were spent with indestructible books in lieu of stuffed
                        animals or plush toys. Throughout her childhood one of her favorite past-times was to curl up
                        with a
                        good book and block out the world. </p>

                <h3>Family</h3>
                <p>Sara attended one of the most diverse high schools in her state. This is where it all started. It was
                    here, in a random sophomore science class that she met the love of her life, Daniel. The young
                    couple were quick friends, bonding on similar interests and goals for a future life. After some time
                    as close friends, the couple became inseparable and soon become the ideal definition of high school
                    sweethearts. Danny moved on to become an Insurance Agent while Sara attended cosmetology school. In
                    2019, the happy couple welcomed their first-born son, and currently only child, into the world. They
                    were married soon thereafter. Being a mother is one of Sara’s greatest joys in life. Sara migrated
                    to working full-time as a stay-at-home mother. She often comments about how proud she is that her
                    son shows the same interests, and promising future as an avid reader. </p>

                <h3>Career</h3>
                <p>Education has always been important to Sara but has not always been able to be the top priority.
                    After finishing cosmetology school, Sara found that it was no longer her path, and left it behind.
                    However, recently Sara has found a renewed vigor for school, going back to put herself on a new path
                    to success. Attending classes while simultaneously caring for her
                    son, Sara became a college graduate earning her Associates in Arts in May
                    of 2022. She is now working towards her Bachelor’s in English and will eventually move on to earn
                    her Master’s. Being a full-time mother and a full-time student did not leave her with much free
                    time. That did not stop her from using what little time she had to start FoxTale Editing – her very
                    own editing company for intendent authors. Sara is looking to eventually break into the world of
                    publishing, essentially turning her lifelong passion of reading into a lifelong career.
